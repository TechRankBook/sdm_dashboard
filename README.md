# Fleet Management Dashboard - Troubleshooting Guide

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Build Failures or Infinite Loading Screen

This application has been regenerated with enhanced error handling and debugging capabilities to resolve common build and loading issues.

## Environment Setup

1. **No environment variables needed** - The application uses hardcoded Supabase credentials for this project
2. **Install dependencies**: 
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Start the application**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Authentication Requirements

- Only users with `role = 'admin'` in the `public.users` table can access the dashboard
- The application will automatically redirect non-admin users and show appropriate error messages

## Debugging Features

### Console Logging
The application now includes extensive console logging to help debug issues:

- **Authentication Flow**: All auth state changes are logged
- **Data Fetching**: API calls and responses are logged
- **Role Verification**: User role checks are logged
- **Route Protection**: Access control decisions are logged

### Loading States
- **Global Loading**: Shows during initial authentication check
- **Component Loading**: Individual components show loading states
- **Error States**: Clear error messages with retry options

### Error Handling
- **Network Errors**: API failures are caught and displayed
- **Authentication Errors**: Login issues show specific error messages
- **Permission Errors**: Role-based access errors are clearly communicated

## Troubleshooting Steps

### If the application won't build:
1. Delete `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`
2. Run `npm install`
3. Check for TypeScript errors in the console

### If you see an infinite loading screen:
1. Open browser developer tools (F12)
2. Check the Console tab for error messages
3. Check the Network tab for failed API requests
4. Look for authentication-related errors

### If login fails:
1. Verify you have a user in `auth.users` 
2. Ensure the user has a corresponding entry in `public.users` with `role = 'admin'`
3. Check Supabase dashboard for RLS policy issues

### Database Issues:
1. Verify all required tables exist in Supabase
2. Check that RLS policies allow admin users to read data
3. Temporarily disable RLS for debugging (remember to re-enable!)

## Key Features Added

- **Robust Authentication**: Comprehensive auth state management
- **Role-Based Access**: Strict admin-only access control  
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful error handling throughout
- **Loading Indicators**: Clear loading states for all operations
- **Debug Information**: Extensive logging for troubleshooting
- **Retry Mechanisms**: Automatic retries for failed requests

## Support

If issues persist:
1. Check browser console (F12) for detailed error logs
2. Verify Supabase connection and database schema
3. Ensure you have proper admin user setup in the database

The application will now provide much clearer feedback about what's happening and why things might not be working.
